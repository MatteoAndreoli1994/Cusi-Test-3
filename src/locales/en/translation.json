    "maisonCusi": "Maison Cusi",
    "intro": "The historic jewelry house founded in 1886 by Annibale Cusi marked the beginning of an era that has lasted for five generations. In these 131 years, Cusi has become one of the most prestigious names among Italian jewelers.",
    "1886": "1886",
    "birth": "Birth of the Cusi brand",
    "birthDescription1": "Annibale Cusi started working at a very young age as an apprentice in a workshop, where the craft was taught through practical experience from early childhood, working closely with goldsmith artisans. For Annibale, it was no different; he began at just 9 years old and quickly gained experience, distinguishing himself for his artistic talent and craftsmanship.",
    "birthDescription2": "The long period spent behind the goldsmith's bench allowed the young Annibale to master the trade, developing the courage and entrepreneurial skills that, at the age of 23 in 1886, led him to leave the workshop and open his own laboratory in Via della Farine in the heart of Milan, just a few steps from the Duomo and Teatro alla Scala.",
    "quote": "Every jewel has its story and represents today's luxury and the time we dedicate to ourselves. Whatever object you choose will be yours, unique and unrepeatable, just like your life.",
    "wellBroochDescription1": "In his Atelier at Via delle Farine, number 8, young Annibale laid the foundations that would, within a few years, establish the Cusi brand as one of the most appreciated by Milanese aristocracy and nobility.",
    "wellBroochDescription2": "The fervent arrival of Art Nouveau at the end of the 19th century revitalized the art of jewelry, referring to nature as the main inspirational subject. In Europe, it was a true revolution in art, and in Milan, the Liberty style promptly emerged. During those years of beauty, Cusi brought to life unique and extraordinary jewelry collections, using innovative materials and rare colored gemstones.",
    "wellBroochLight": "On the left, the famous Well Brooch in platinum and diamonds, along with its design, created by Annibale and still affectionately preserved by the Cusi family.",
    "maryStuartNecklaceTitle": "Mary Stuart Necklace",
    "maryStuartNecklaceDescription": "In 1906, Milan was the protagonist of the International Exhibition, a great success, with the participation of 40 states and nearly 5 million visitors to the city, a record for the time. In the section dedicated to Decorative Arts, Cusi exhibited its jewelry and won the Grand Prize with a masterpiece of goldsmith art, the necklace called “Mary Stuart”, a work that took two years of work by the workshop's artisans to create in “Platiuralium”, a special alloy invented by Cusi composed of platinum, gold, silver, and aluminum with unique lightness characteristics. The “Collar” was adorned with about 15,000 diamonds, pearls, and rubies. The architecture was complex as all parts were articulated, allowing for articulated movements. Those who wrote about it described it as, despite its grandeur, light as lace.",
    "viaClericiTitle": "Via Clerici, 1",
    "viaClericiDescription": "After the painful parenthesis of the Great War 1915-18, Annibale Cusi, now an internationally renowned expert in precious stones and pearls, resumed his activity with renewed energy. Expansion became necessary, leading in 1922 Annibale and his twenty-seven-year-old son Rinaldo to build the elegant Palazzo Cusi at Via Clerici 1, the family's headquarters, sales atelier, and production laboratories. In 1921, Annibale was proclaimed a Knight of Labor.",
    "rinaldoCusiTitle": "Rinaldo Cusi",
    "rinaldoCusiDescription": "In the twentieth century, the Cusi brand was appreciated not only by the most important Milanese aristocratic families but also by the Italian Royal Family, boasting numerous collaborations for King Vittorio Emanuele III, with S.A.R. Vittorio Emanuele, Count of Turin, and Duke of Aosta Amedeo di Savoia. In those years, the three royal emblems adorned the letterhead and logo of the Cusi Jewelry.\n\nWith great skill and charisma, Rinaldo also exported our style abroad, where the international market responded with wide approval. Always a great expert and collector of jewelry, precious gems, and especially pearls, he handed over the reins of the company to his son Roberto Cusi.",
    "robertoCusiTitle": "Roberto Cusi",
    "robertoCusiDescription": "Under Roberto Cusi (1926 – 1996), the company consolidated, and in 1964 the exclusive headquarters in Portofino was inaugurated, followed by the current headquarters in Milan at Via Montenapoleone 21 just two years later, a symbolic location for fashion and luxury worldwide. Subsequently, in 2004, at the Portofino branch, Cusi became an official ROLEX dealer, and in 2013, an Atelier was entirely dedicated to it next to its jewelry store.",
    "familyTitle": "The Cusi tradition continues with the new generations.",
    "familyIntro": "The historic jewelry house founded in 1886 by Annibale Cusi marked the beginning of an era that has lasted for five generations; in these 131 years, Cusi has become one of the most prestigious names among Italian jewelers.",
    "familyDescription": "Today, the tradition continues thanks to the commitment and passion of Giorgio Nicola Cusi, his wife Roberta Cusi, and their children Alessia and Alessandro. Cusi is not just a name: it is passion, professionalism, security, tradition; it is something familiar. Our goal is to make our customers feel at home.\n\nThis brief retrospective recounts the history, evolution of the concept of jewelry, and how we are tied to tradition while maintaining the quality of the past and introducing a perspective of modernity and design. Italian haute jewelry, based on tradition and innovation, which can be admired at the locations on Via Montenapoleone and in Portofino, embodies the highest expressions of art such as design, craftsmanship, attention to detail, and the search for rare gems from the remotest corners of the earth. It is with this philosophy that the Cusi family wants to pass on the tradition to the new generations."
